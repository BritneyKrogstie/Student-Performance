# Student-Performance
I will be looking at different factors that can affect student's performances. I used data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelhemaly/students-grading-dataset?resource=download
|Chart Number | Title | Description and Analysis|
|:-----------:| ------------ | ---------- |
|1| Hours of sleep for average total score | I took the sleep hours for each students and averaged the Total Score for them. It seems that there is no correlation between the two. The average did not increase or decrease depending on how much sleep the student received.
